### It's the Little Things
A good user interface is vital for any website or application. It's the very first thing that the user sees and interacts with, so for the same reason you'd only wear business casual to a job interview, making a good impression is everything. But what exactly makes a UI 'good'? Let's first take a look at these two examples:

</p>

At first glance it's clear which design gives a better impression. The one on the left is messy and hard to read. The background does not provide enough contrast against the text, making some words completely indiscernible. The profile names and images are misaligned with overall very poor formatting. The overall impression this first example gives is disorganized and unprofessional. The second one, on the other hand, is much easier on the eyes. It's clean, organized and easy-to-read, with all elements of the page formatted nicely and evenly. This page says ,"organized and professional." Having a good presentation is paramount for any user-interface, and these examples show what a difference it makes.

Another consideration of a good UI is functionality. A website that's hard to navigate is just as bad as an ugly website. Confusing layout, improperly named links, and no navigation bar are some of the hallmarks of bad UI design. If it takes a user more than 10 seconds to find the login, then maybe it's time to rethink the design. Here's an absolutely hilarious website with intentionally bad UI design: https://userinyerface.com/game.html. 

Learning how to create good design like this was the focus of the User Interface Frameworks modules. A UI Framework is a collection of classes and interfaces that create a structure for designing user interfaces. In class we began creating websites with raw HTML and CSS, seen in the first 'History of Surfing' example, and then learned how to utilize UI Frameworks like React to create properly designed websites, as seen in the second example. While making good websites is a great skill to have, learning the importance of good design goes beyound just web design. Good design is important in everyday life, not just a website. Think of all the products you use on a daily basis-phone, toaster oven, TV remote. Good design is critical to make a product appealing and useful to the everyday user. Like imagine giving people an aneurysm everytime they want to ride the elevator:

</p>

Aside from functionality, appearance is also important in good design. Think of all the signs and billboards you drive past on your way to work/school. Advertisements like this need to clear, concise, eye-catching. Especially if the advertisement is for a business, how they present themselves speaks volumes to their professionalism and trustworthiness. The importance of good UI design that we learned goes beyond just creating websites. It's something that we need in everyday life.
