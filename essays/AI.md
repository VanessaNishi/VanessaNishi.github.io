### I. Introduction
Lately, AI has become the enemy of modern education. As early as last semester, every class syllabus I’ve received came with some kind of warning to not use AI in any way, shape or form. It many ways, it can be abused by students as a means to cut corners in class. To combat this, some educators have been using AI themselves. AI detectors like Turnitin have often used to check students’ work for use of AI or plagiarism. However, the accuracy of such detectors has been called into question, as multiple incidents arose of students being accused of cheating for having essays flagged for high levels plagiarism/AI usage, when in reality, the essays were written honestly.

In comparison to my other classes, which prohibit any use of AI, ICS 314 is the only class I’ve ever had that actually encourages students to use it. I’ve used ChatGpt occasionally for looking up the code for something simple that I forgot (e.g. “how to change the background color in css”) or for coding examples. Although my use of it has been very limited, I found it helpful when I needed simple questions answered fast.


### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
   I don’t remember for which experiences specifically, but I used ChatGPT for module 10(HTML, CSS). This module introduced a lot of new syntax and it was hard to remember all of it, so I asked it simple things like “how to write a comment in HTML,” “what is <hr />,” “how to change the color of text.” I also asked it what the difference was between margins and borders and it answered with a visual representation, which was very helpful in understanding the concept.
   I also used it in module 11, specifically for E36: Your Choice with Bootstrap 5. There were many times when I wanted to format things a certain way so I would ask ChatGPT how to do it (e.g. how to make navbar align right?). Often times the answer it gave did work, but sometimes it didn’t and I would resort back to Google and stackOverflow.

2. In-class Practice WODs
   I did not use AI, I would also go to Google or StackOverflow if I had a question. Looking back, I think I had some kind of mistrust in AI, and that I couldn’t always trust the answer it gave me. I felt more comfortable getting the information from a website or a random on stackOverflow.
3. In-class WODs
   I did not use AI, for similar reasons. I was more worried because I didn’t want to mess up during the WOD. I would mostly reference my old code if I forgot how to code something.
4. Essays
   I’ve never used AI on an essay. The professors put a lot of emphasis on using your own voice, so I never used it to write any part of an essay. I never really thought to use it as a spellchecker, but I think I will for future essay. I think it’s very helpful in that regard.
5. Final project
   I’ve haven’t used AI on the final project. Most of the work has been doable without it, since most it has been similar to digits, in which I’m just reworking the template and adjusting the css. For things I didn’t know how to do, like implementing a search bar, I used a YouTube tutorial and not AI. I didn’t think to use AI at the time, but as I’m writing this I just looked up how to do it in ChatGPT and it gave me about the same thing the YouTube tutorial did, so I probably could’ve used AI and saved some time.
6. Learning a concept / tutorial
   I’ve asked ChatGPT to explain things like <form> in HTML and card in bootstrap. It provided example code and explanations of the different components which I found helpful.
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
   I’ve never used AI to help answer a question because their questions were very specific and required you to actually look at their code/files in order to help. For example, “While I was deleting files, all of a sudden my local page went white. Why is this happening?” This is not the kind of problem AI can diagnose, so I didn’t use it here.
8. Asking or answering a smart-question
   For similar reasons as #7 I didn’t use AI here either.
9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
   I have used AI for coding examples of things like bootstrap cards and navbar, because they have such specific formatting that it’s hard to remember off-hand. ChatGPT gave a example and explained each of the components which was very helpful.
10. Explaining code
    I’ve used AI to explain things I didn’t understand like “gx-3” or <hr />. It provided an explanation and example code which was very helpful.
11. Writing code
    I’ve never asked it to write code for me, only examples of something I was attempting to create.
12. Documenting code
    I’ve never used AI here because I felt like I could maintain good code documentation without it.
13. Quality assurance
    I haven’t used AI here. If I had trouble with code, I would look for a solution on stackOverflow.
14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
    None

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
I believe that overall, AI has helped enhance my learning of software engineering concepts. I've found that it's primary benefit is it's efficiency. As opposed to sifting through multiple websites or scrubbing through YouTube videos looking for the answers, AI applications like ChatGPT automatically provide the answer with a comprehensive explanation of the concept and a handy example. A potential five-minute-long Google search or Youtube video summed up in a few seconds. 

### IV. Practical Applications:
AI has found much usage in a variety of applications outside of ICS 314 and even outside of software engineering in general. One application is the world of visual effects of VFX. Back in 2011, the massively popular tv-show Game of Thrones aired it's first season, introducing one of it's most iconic characters, Daenerys Targaryen. In A Song of Ice and Fire, the book series the show is based on, all Targaryens have the signature characteristics of white hair and purple eyes. However, while the TV-Targaryens sport their stunning platinum blonde hair, the iconic purple eyes of their book-counterparts never made it to the big-screen. According to the creators, CGI was too complicated and expensive and violet contacts were uncomfortable for the actors and hindered their performance. Ultimately, VFX limitations prevented some of these iconic details from the books from making it on-screen. 
Fast forward 12-ish years to when the movie Dune Part Two is being created. In that the movie there is a group of people called the Fremen, who have characteristic blue eyes. Due to the large amount of Fremen characters, the work to digitally color all of their eyes would have been difficult, but special effects team found a clever solution. VFX supervisor Paul Lambert stated in official production notes,

>We came up with a different technique, using what we’d learned before from the hundreds of blue eye shots in the first movie and creating a machine learning model, an algorithm trained from those ‘Dune’ shots to find human eyes in an image, which would then give us a matte for the different parts of the eye. We then used this multi-part matte to tint the eyes blue. Some worked better than others, those others we did by hand. It actually went full circle sometimes, in that we had to take out some of the blue eyes that got generated in the non-Freman characters, rather than add them, as the algorithm would just find eyes, whether they were Freman, Harkonnen or Sardaukar! But, it was a brand new technique, getting that done.

In other words, instead of having a VFX artist identify the eyes frame by frame, the VFX team utilized AI to find the eyes instead. As Lambert stated, the algorithm was not perfect and required artists to adjust or undo some of it's work, but it ultimately cut down many hours of what otherwise would've been very tedious work. In this instance, AI helped made a task that ten years ago would've been very complicated, expensive and tedious, feasible. This highlights one of the great upsides of AI, in that it can automate the menial and tedious tasks, allowing the user to focus on more complex work. This advantage applies to software engineering as well, as AI can be used to writing starting code, writing tests and test cases, do error checking, etc. Similar to the eye tracking algorithm used in Dune, such uses of AI are imperfect and require review, but ultimately can save a programmer hours of menial work.
