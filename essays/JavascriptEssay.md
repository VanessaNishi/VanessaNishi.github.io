  I just finished a paint-by-numbers kit of Howl and Sophie, two characters from my favorite movie of all time, Howl’s Moving Castle. The concept is very straightforward—paint the areas labeled with a number with the corresponding numbered paint color and over time the image will come together. As someone who also enjoys drawing and painting traditionally (as in on a blank canvas), I found the differences in these methods of art to be similar to the differences between Javascript and Java or C. The method of paint-by-numbers is very restrictive, in that you’re only allowed to put a certain color in a certain place on the canvas. If I suddenly decided that I wanted my portrait of Howl and Sophie to also include another character, Turnip Head, with a paint-by-numbers this would be possible, but time-consuming. I’d probably have to paint over some of the outlines with white, redraw the outlines and paint him in. On a blank canvas, the process of painting is much freer. I can put color anywhere that I want. If I want to add Turnip Head, I can just erase my lines and pop him in. You could, in theory, achieve the same image through either method, but one is more restrictive, and perhaps more tedious than the other. I feel the same way about Javascript vs the other languages I’ve learned, which are Java and C. When doing the WODs, the syntax came fairly easily once I figured out the algorithm because I didn’t have to think about writing the type of the variables, or the syntax for length because it’s the same for strings and arrays, or the syntax to compare strings because I can literally just use the === operator. Another big difference was arrays! In Java, arrays are static so the size of them can’t be changed after they’ve been created. So, if you wanted to add an element to an array, you’d have to create an array of size n + 1 and copy the elements of the old array into the new array with a loop of some kind. In Javascript, you can just use push and you’re done! A whole bunch of lines and loops in Java summed up into one single command in Javascript. Javascript simplifies quite a few things in a way that just makes sense. 
  
  The ES6 lessons introduced a lot of new concepts that I’ve never seen in the other programming languages I’ve learned, like destructuring, arrow functions and promises. I still don’t quite understand destructuring and I don’t think I’d be able to use any of these concepts practically yet. 
  
  The first two WODs went surprisingly okay. It gave me some reassurance that I understand at least the very basics of Javascript so far. It’s stressful but also exciting. Being able to create a solution on the fly felt very rewarding even if it was very simple. I’m still nervous about how difficult the WODs may get as we learn more about Javascript. I’m most worried about getting a WOD and having no idea how to solve it, but hopefully with enough preparation I’ll be able to get through them.
