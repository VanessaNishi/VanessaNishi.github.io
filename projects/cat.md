summary: "The adoption preparation and daily care I do for my cat."
---

My family and I adopted our cat, Chi in August 2022. Aside from three mice and a goldfish that tragically ended its life by jumping out of the fishtank when we were kids, we had never owned a long-term pet before. It took a lot of preparation to be ready to bring Chi home. My sister and I were in charge of creating a plan of care as well as researching and buying all the needed supplies--food(wet & dry), food/water bowls, litter boxes, litter, toys, flea medicine, beds etc. Fun fact: we bought a $15 cat bed for her only for it to go completely unused because she much prefers the luxury and comfort of the Amazon cardboard box it came in. 

Daily care involves feeding her in the morning and night, as well as playtime and outside-time (she likes to go exploring in our backyard) in the morning and late afternoonish (5pm-8ish pm). Taking care of her daily taught me a lot about responsibility and time management, especially because cats function on a schedule. Feeding her at the proper times, always checking her litter box, making sure we're stocked up on food, litter, other supplies, as well as dedicating time everyday to play with her; these are all things we have to manage to ensure Chi is a happy and healthy kitty.
